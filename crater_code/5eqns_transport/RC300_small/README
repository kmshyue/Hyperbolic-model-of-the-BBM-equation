To run the code:
1. make clear
2. make
3. ./xclaw

The data files areR claw2ez.data and setprob.data

Note that 
1. in claw2ez.data
(i)   method(2) = 2 means SSPRK22 and method(3) = 3 SSPRK33
(ii)  method(9) = 1 means standard MUSCL (or TVD2) interpolation scheme
(iii) method(9) = 2 means standard MUSCL interpolation scheme for cells
     \alpha (volume fraction) <= alpha_min and
     THINC modification for interface cells (\alpha > \alpha_min
     and fulfil monotone condition)

2. in setprob.data
(i) thinc_beta is the parameter for THINC to adjust the sharpness 
    of the hyperbolic tangent profile, typical value is between
    2.3 and 1.5, for example. The larger the value is, the sharper
    the profile is. 
(ii) vofmin means \alpha_min mentioned above 1(ii).

3. Graphic
(i) Use plotsnap.m for 1D depth average plots of surface displacement 
    and radial velocity
(ii) Use plotclr.m for 2D pseudo-color plot


4. CPU time (second)s 
On a Mac studio with Apple M2 Ultra chips and 128G memory,
it tooks
(i)   6305.37939 on a 1250x250  grid
(ii)  52849.5664 on a 2500x500  grid
(iii) 423522.406 on a 5000x1000 grid
