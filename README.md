This is a sample multifluid code written in F77 for a two-phase (air-water) model crater cavity simulation in 2D. The model system is the 5-equation transport equation with geometrical and gravitational source terms. The numerical method is the semi-discrete wave propagation method with THINC interface sharpening reconstruction.
